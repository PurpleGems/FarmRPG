A horrible learning experience 
This is a project I'm currently working on in hopes to learn how to program games / program in general
a huge goal for me to acomplish in life is to be able to create just about anything I can think of
(to some limits ofc) but that would be amazing :)

Also everything in this project I try to create myself
(pixel art) but some stuff are borrowed from other games
just so I can learn a bit quicker but I do wanna learn
to make pixel art so its a double bonus!
nothing here im planning on selling all just learning!
if there is some stuff ive used that arnt mine
id change it out anyways.
